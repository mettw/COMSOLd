TODO list
=========

* Which files should be general in nature (common for all users) but 
  aren't?
    o derived_values.mlx
    o get_cut_plane_fields.mlx
    o create_fft_of_cut_plane.mlx
* COMSOLd should not crash if a user's completed/ directory is missing - it
  should create it if allowed instead.
* Create two post-processing routines: The built-in one and a user 
  supplied one.  The built-in one:
    o Processes each output file seperately and creates a new MATLAB file
      for it.
    o How should we deal with frq, ind_frq etc in the derived value 
      output?  Perhaps we should have another field in the mph definition
      so that when the mph definition is created automatically the user
      only has to add lists of frq etc to the export table.
