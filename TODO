TODO list
=========

* Which files should be general in nature (common for all users) but 
  aren't?
    o derived_values.mlx
    o get_cut_plane_fields.mlx
    o create_fft_of_cut_plane.mlx
* COMSOLd should not crash if a user's completed/ directory is missing - it
  should create it if allowed instead.
* Create user post-processing routine.  Create general function for doing
  FFT of cut planes.
