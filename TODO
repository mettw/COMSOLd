TODO list
=========

* The function get_COMSOLd_dir() should work out what the directory is by where the mlx file is.  This function could then
  be moved to run_comsol.mlx.
* Which files should be general in nature (common for all users) but aren't?
* COMSOLd should not crash if a user's completed/ directory is missing - it should create it if allowed instead.
